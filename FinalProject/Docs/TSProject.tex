	\section{Introduction}
	Project management consists, basically, in the organization of a project, where a client requires objectives to be completed, so this have a process with planning, organizing, leading, controlling resources to complete the goals at a time frame, this involves coordinating tasks, managing people, overseeing activities, etc in a efficiently and effectively way.
	
	\section{Why a Chatbot?}
	
	A chatbot is program which simulates an human conversation with a final user, in the new times, those chatbots are equipped with artificial intelligence, which offers a better conversation, to answer questions, solve problems, give recommendations, etc. In our context, a chatbot allow to offer up a help in project management in all parts of a project.
	
	With external information, our chatbot can be entrenaited to give tips to better planning, organizing, leading, controlling resources, making more efficiently and effectively the solution.
